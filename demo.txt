Okay, here's a markdown-like demo text designed to showcase your colorization tool's ability to handle panels, bolds, italics, nested lists, and inline markup:

## Demonstration of Markdown Coloring

Here's a quick demo to show how your tool can handle various Markdown elements. This includes:

**1. Panels & Emphasis:**

```
Note: This is a panel!  It should be color-coded distinctively.  
  *   Like this nested li within the panel   *and* **bolded here** ...
```

This is an **important** section.  The `panel` above highlights content, which you can style differently with color, I believe.  You can also use *italics*, and **bold**.

**2. Lists & Inline elements:**

A simple list:

1.  Item one.
2.  *Item two, with an item that is italicized*.
3.  **Item three, with inline bold.**  And some *more italics* and a mix and match.
    1. Nested item a.
    2. Nested item b, with a [link](https://example.com).
           * **Even deeper nest:** and still colored!
    3.  Nested item c *with italics.*

**3. Code Blocks (Optional, but good to include for completeness):**

Here's a code block:

```python
def hello_world():
  print("Hello, world!")
```

This is the end of our demonstration.  Hopefully, the different highlighting will work as I describe! Enjoy!
```

**Explanation of Features and Colorization Hints:**

*   **Panels (e.g., the `Note:` block):** These can be rendered with a background color and border for emphasis, so that users feel it's an important remark.
*   **Bold (`**`):**  Highlight important text with a bold font weight and a specific color for importance -- maybe orange (warning) or something darker.
*   **Italics (`*`):** Emphasize text with italics and a subtle color. This could be a lighter shade than the bold.
*   **Nested Lists with inline Markdown:**  The list items should maintain bullet points. Items should remain in the same style even when nesting and *mixed*.
*   **Links (`[text](url)`):**  These links should be colored in a specific way, possibly with an underline to mimic a hyperlink.
*   **Code Blocks (````):**  Code blocks are also good to have as they should styled differently based on their content to make it easier to read.
*   **General Textflow:** Make sure the inline formatting doesn't create conflicts or break the expected flow.

This demo text should give your tool a good workout!  Good luck!

# Panel Showcase Example

This document demonstrates how `llm-style.py` uses `rich.panel.Panel` to render code blocks and blockquotes, especially with the `panel-showcase-style.json`.

## Code Blocks

Panels are used for code blocks fenced by triple backticks.

### Code Block with Language Hint

If a language is specified after the opening fence, it should appear as the panel title, styled according to `style_code_panel_title`. The syntax highlighting inside depends on `pygments`.

```python
import sys
from rich.console import Console

console = Console()

def greet(name: str):
  """Greets the user."""
  if not name:
    console.print("[bold red]Error:[/bold red] Name cannot be empty!")
    sys.exit(1)
  console.print(f"Hello, [bold cyan]{name}[/bold cyan]! Welcome.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  greet("Panel User")
